This is a simple command-line Notes Manager application developed using Java. The program allows users to add notes and view saved notes using file handling concepts. It uses FileWriter to write notes into a text file and FileReader with BufferedReader to read and display the stored notes. The application runs in a loop-based menu system where users can choose to add a note, view all notes, or exit the program. This project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as file handling, exception handling, loops, and user input using Scanner.
